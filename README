Add piano marking to continuo at m 164.


Sonata 3:

Add missing fermata at m 24 (vln. I & II, basso), m 62 (vln. I & II,
basso).


Sonata 4:

Add missing fermata at m 59 (vln. I & II, continuo) and m 95 (vln. I
& II, continuo).

Add dynamic marks to bass and continuo at m 91.


Sonata 5:

Add missing fermata at m 23 (vln. I & II, continuo), m 44 (vln. I &
II, continuo) and m 100 (vln. I & II, continuo).


Sonata 6:

Add missing fermata at m 47 (vln. I), m 93 (vln. I, continuo) and
m 135 (vln. I, basso).

Add dynamic markings at m 173.


Sonata 7:
Fermata at m 26 and m 71 are missing in Vln. I. Added them.

m 79 has double-barline between notes. Moved to end of measure.

First note in continuo at m 40 is C natural instead of C# (as
in the bass).

m 45 continuo beat three has '6 - 5 4' but upper voices move
6 4 - 5 3

The penultimate movement is marked ‘vivace’ in violin I and
bass, but ‘allegro’ in violin II and continuo.


Sonata 8:

Last movement is marked ‘allegro’ in the bass but ‘vivace’ in
other parts.

Fermata at m 124 are missing in vln. I and continuo. Added them.


Sonata 9:

Add missing fermata at m 26 (vln. I, bass), m 79 (vln. I and II)
and m 129 (vln. I and continuo).

Added piano marking to continuo at m 115 (appears in all
other parts).


Sonata 10:

Add missing fermata at m 33 (vln. I) and m 87 (vln. I).


Sonata 11:

Change A♭ to A♮ in basso at m 95. (Missing accidental in the
MS found through comparison with the continuo.)

Add missing fermata at m 8 (vln. I, II, basso), m 22 (vln. I),
m 52 (vln. I), m 68 (vln. I, basso) and m 134 (continuo).

Note: The MS continuo part has 5 4 — 6 5 for the first beat of
m 103. This does not seem to be a typo, although the other parts
might suggest it. It has been preserved here.


Sonata 12:

I’m uncertain what the right placement of the figured bass is
at m 46.

Change bass figure in m 106 from ♯4 2 to 4 2. Placement is ambiguous
in the MS, but ♯4 makes no sense anywhere in the measure.

Add missing fermata at m 14 (vln. I), m 43 (vln. I, continuo),
m 83 (vln. I), m 118 (vln. I & II, continuo) and m 182 (vln. II)
