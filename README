Henry Purcell — 12 Sonatas of Three Parts, Z 790–801 (1683)

This edition was produced directly from the parts published by
John Playford in 1685. It is a verbatim transcription, except for
the following changes:

    * Ternary meters are written in modern style (3/2, 3/4, etc.)
      instead of Purcell’s dotted-half-circle notation.

    * Accidentals apply through the measure in which they appear.
      (The MS adds an accidental to every altered note.)

    * Naturals are used where the MS has a sharped flat.

    * Fermata that appear in one voice have been added to the
      others. (See specific edits below.)

    * A few unambiguous misprints have been fixed.

Specific Edits
==============

Sonata 1:

Add missing fermata at m 24 (vln. I & II), m 66 (vln. I & II) and
m 119 (vln. I & II, basso).


Sonata 2:

Add missing fermata at m 29 (vln. I & II), m 118 (vln. I & II, basso).

Add piano marking to continuo at m 164.


Sonata 3:

Add missing fermata at m 24 (vln. I & II, basso), m 62 (vln. I & II,
basso).

Correct first 8th of m 60 in continuo from C♮ to C♯.


Sonata 4:

Add missing fermata at m 59 (vln. I & II, continuo) and m 95 (vln. I
& II, continuo).

Add dynamic marks to bass and continuo at m 91.


Sonata 5:

Add missing fermata at m 23 (vln. I & II, continuo), m 44 (vln. I &
II, continuo) and m 100 (vln. I & II, continuo).


Sonata 6:

Add missing fermata at m 47 (vln. I), m 93 (vln. I, continuo) and
m 135 (vln. I, basso).

Add dynamic markings at m 173.


Sonata 7:

Added missing fermata at m 26 and m 71 in vln. I.

m 79 in the MS has double-barline between notes. Moved to end
of measure.

First note in continuo at m 40 in the MS is C♮. Corrected it to C♯.

m 45 continuo beat three has ‘6 — 5 4’ in the MS, which seems to
be a mistake. I have changed it to ‘6 4 — 5 3’.

The penultimate movement is marked ‘vivace’ in violin I and
bass, but ‘allegro’ in violin II and continuo.


Sonata 8:

Last movement is marked ‘allegro’ in the bass but ‘vivace’ in
other parts.

Fermata at m 124 are missing in vln. I and continuo. Added them.


Sonata 9:

Add missing fermata at m 26 (vln. I, bass), m 79 (vln. I and II)
and m 129 (vln. I and continuo).

Added piano marking to continuo at m 115 (appears in all
other parts).


Sonata 10:

Add missing fermata at m 33 (vln. I) and m 87 (vln. I).


Sonata 11:

Change A♭ to A♮ in basso at m 95. (Missing accidental in the
MS found through comparison with the continuo.)

Add missing fermata at m 8 (vln. I, II, basso), m 22 (vln. I),
m 52 (vln. I), m 68 (vln. I, basso) and m 134 (continuo).

Note: The MS continuo part has 5 4 — 6 5 for the first beat of
m 103. This does not seem to be a typo, although the other parts
might suggest it. It has been preserved here.


Sonata 12:

I’m uncertain what the right placement of the figured bass is
at m 46.

Change bass figure in m 106 from ♯4 2 to 4 2. Placement is ambiguous
in the MS, but ♯4 makes no sense anywhere in the measure.

Add missing fermata at m 14 (vln. I), m 43 (vln. I, continuo),
m 83 (vln. I), m 118 (vln. I & II, continuo) and m 182 (vln. II)
